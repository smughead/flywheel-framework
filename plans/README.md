# Plans

This directory stores implementation plans created through the `/workflows:plan` skill.

## Purpose

Plans document multi-step feature implementations, breaking complex work into manageable phases. They serve as a reference during implementation and help maintain context across sessions.

## File Naming

Use descriptive names that indicate the feature:
- `user-authentication-plan.md`
- `api-v2-migration-plan.md`
- `performance-optimization-phase1.md`

## Template

See `../knowledge/TEMPLATES.md` for the plan file template, or use the `/workflows:plan` skill which will create properly formatted plans automatically.
