# Learnings

This directory stores learnings captured through the `/compound` skill.

## Purpose

Learnings document insights, fixes, and discoveries from your development sessions. They help Claude remember what worked (and what didn't) for future similar tasks.

## File Naming

Use date-prefixed names: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

Examples:
- `2026-01-15-authentication-token-refresh.md`
- `2026-01-16-swiftui-navigation-fix.md`

## Template

See `../TEMPLATES.md` for the learning file template, or use the `/compound` skill which will create properly formatted learnings automatically.
